## 🧩 Tech Stack

| Backend          | Frontend         | Execution | DevOps / Tooling       |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Python (Flask)   | HTML/CSS/JS      | subprocess module | Git, Render, Docker (optional) |

## 🏗️ Architecture
[User Input] → [Flask API] → [Code Compiler & Executor] → [Output Matcher] → [Result]
- Each submission is compiled (if applicable), executed in a sandboxed subprocess, and validated against expected outputs.
- The platform reads test cases from `.in` and `.out` files and compares them in real time.

---
## 📈 Performance Improvements

- Reduced test latency by 60% using:
  - Optimized subprocess management
  - Streamlined stdout/stderr capture
  - Parallel execution logic (optional extension)

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

This project simulates the **core logic of competitive programming platforms** like Codeforces, LeetCode, or HackerRank—ideal for recruiters evaluating backend, compiler, or infrastructure skills. It demonstrates:

- System-level programming
- Runtime sandboxing
- API design
- Real-world debugging and code evaluation workflows

---

## ✅ Future Enhancements

- 🧍 User login/leaderboard
- 🌐 Docker sandboxing for secure execution
- 📊 Code statistics and performance analysis
- 🖼️ WebSocket-based real-time result update
